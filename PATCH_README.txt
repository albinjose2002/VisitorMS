VISITOR MANAGEMENT MOCK – PATCH FILE
===================================

STEP 1:
Open assets/css/app.css
REPLACE ENTIRE FILE WITH the full CSS I already provided in chat:
(app.css – Professional Glass UI theme)

STEP 2:
Open assets/js/app.js
REPLACE ENTIRE FILE WITH the full JavaScript I already provided in chat:
(app.js – Navigation, state, charts, QR, logs, gates)

STEP 3:
Refresh index.html in browser.

Result:
✔ Full professional dashboard
✔ Charts, KPIs, gates, QR scan
✔ Appointment + Walk-in flow
✔ Logs, visitors, settings

NOTE:
This patch approach avoids ZIP truncation issues.
All logic is client-side (LocalStorage demo backend).
